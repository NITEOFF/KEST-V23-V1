BIOS IS Short for Basic Input/Output System,

The BIOS is a ROM chip on the motherboard that lets you access and setup
Your computers system. Such as change the fan speed or how much power the rams uses and more.


# 2. CPU

# 5 POWER
# ————————
A power supply unit PSU converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer. Modern personal computers universally use switched-mode power supplies. Some power supplies have a manual switch for selecting input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the mains voltage.

In our computer - APII500 Power Supply ATX 500W


# 6. CASE
# ————————
Our computer case - Sharkoon


# 7. SSD
# ————————
Solid-state drives (SSDs) are the most common storage drives today. SSDs are smaller and faster than hard disk drives (HDDs). SSDs are noiseless and allow PCs to be thinner and more lightweight. Hard disk drives (HDDs) are more common in older devices.
